Big mart sales prediction and deployment using heroku server
# Problem Statement
The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.

Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and stores which play a key role in increasing sales.

The Data
We have train (8523) and test (5681) data set, train data set has both input and output variable(s). You need to predict the sales for test data set.


Variable	Description
Item_Identifier	Unique product ID  
Item_Weight	Weight of product
Item_Fat_Content	Whether the product is low fat or not
Item_Visibility	The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product
Item_Type	The category to which the product belongs
Item_MRP	Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
Outlet_Identifier	Unique store ID
Outlet_Establishment_Year	The year in which store was established
Outlet_Size	The size of the store in terms of ground area covered
Outlet_Location_Type	The type of city in which the store is located
Outlet_Type	Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
Item_Outlet_Sales	Sales of the product in the particulat store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.
